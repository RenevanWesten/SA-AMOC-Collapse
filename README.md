These directories contain Python (v3) scripts for plotting/analysing model output.

Python scripts can be found in the directory 'Program'.
Model output can be found in the directory 'Data'.

The processed model output are stored as NETCDF files and using the relevant scripts one can regenerate all the figures.
We provided parts of the original model output (native grid) and is only converted to yearly-averaged data (due to storage limitations). 
Some scripts (e.g., FOV_index_34S.py and AMOC_transport.py) use the original model output, the generated time series are already available in the relevant directories.
